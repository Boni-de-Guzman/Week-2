const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, it gathers all necessary details for the created idea"
const design = " The third step where different designs are created and considered appropriate for a project"
const testingAndIntegration = "The fourth step where multiples testing is needed to ensure the stability of a certain project before migrating for production"
const implementation = "The fifth step which all the neceesary requirements are met for developing a project   "
